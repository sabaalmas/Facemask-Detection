# Project dataset:
The dataset for this project was built using subsets of images from various publicly available datasets. A compressed version of the primary dataset (“project_dataset.zip”) that was built can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E1t9aPFxyTwV4gkiHKJS_a6pF4EwjGSh/view?usp=sharing

It has a “sources.txt” file that provides information about how to reach the sources.

However, for ease of use in the project, the images from different sources are combined together and a final dataset is formed. A compressed version of the final dataset (“final_dataset.zip”) can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D8zoLuddkJjMmP8DKDedasWs1JlNVTHD/view?usp=sharing

A folder ("app_mode_samples") containing 5 sample images is also created to test the single input prediction for the model. A compressed version of the folder ("app_mode_samples.zip") can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/16e7I6w59neU41ambU7QOtstTAphpJ4i5/view?usp=sharing

# Steps to execute:
1. Please ensure that the "final_dataset" and "app_mode_samples" folders for the project are present in the same location as the project notebook before executing the project
2. Please ensure that "saved_model" file is present in the same location as the project notebook before executing the project
